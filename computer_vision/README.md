# Computer vision resources

Originally, in 2020, the project included computer vision research aspects. These were later removed when the client mentioned they weren't actually needed.

These files have some resources with the work done towards that, in case it is brought back into the project.

* facial_detection: uses a haar cascade to detect a face in a frame. Adapted from a COSC428 lab.
* pine_data_capture: includes software adapted from a COSC428 lab to collect RGBD footage of pine trees using a NUC mounted on a drone. The drone was piloted by Kelvin Barnsdale, a senior researcher in the CSSE department.
