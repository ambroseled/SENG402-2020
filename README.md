## Getting started

The [Wiki](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/eba54/wilding-pines-fyp/wikis/Home) contains all the knowledge, archiecture diagrams, user stories, links to resources, etc. for the project created during 2020. Make sure to read it and keep it updated :100:

### With C# solutions

1. Install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. Open the `.sln` file in an IDE such as IntelliJ's Rider or Microsoft's Visual Studio (we recommend Rider).

### With the Android app

1. Open the `wildingPinesUi` directory in Android Studio.
2. To run the app on your device you will need to have an Android emulator, or physical device. Make sure that you select the appropriate API host in ApiHostSettings.kt, you can right click on the object name and select `Find usages` to see where around the app these settings are used.

### Putting the hardware together

Refer to the latest architecture and hardware interaction diagrams in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sAU_884tumgwr10lZ3P0hwrgOGOeOH1v?usp=sharing) in `2020 > Diagrams > Architecture`.
